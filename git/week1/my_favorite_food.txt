Chef's Salad

Tear the lettuce into bite-sized pieces and put into a large mixing bowl. 
Season with salt and pepper to taste and toss with 1/2 cup of the dressing. 
Divide the lettuce among 4 large individual serving bowls. 
Arrange the cheese, meats, eggs, and avocado, like the spokes of a wheel, on top of each salad. 
Scatter the tomatoes, cucumbers, and croutons on top. 
Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve and pass the remaining dressing at the table.
